## Description

Dynamic charts created with https://www.chartjs.org/. The data has been hard-coded, meaning that is integrated in it's respective ``.js`` file, along with the functional code. Therefor, there is no unique database from which the data is called. However, it is possible to use a ``.csv`` file. A good example for future reference is the following by [Peter Cook](https://twitter.com/peter_r_cook):

## Duplicated data files

Some files are duplicated, such as ``cost.js`` cand ``cost2.js``. They are the same data implementation but with different structures. Due to the fact that ``chart.js`` have different versions (2.0, 3.0 and 4.0), with some features not backwards compatible, so I have been testing versions and expressions.
